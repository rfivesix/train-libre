Train Libre is an open-source, offline-first fitness app for logging workouts, calories, macros, bodyweight, and recovery — without ads, mandatory accounts, or analytics SDKs.

Designed for people who want serious tracking without social feeds, gamification, or subscription pressure, Train Libre prioritizes **privacy**, **local data ownership**, and **transparent analytics**.

## Platform Support

Train Libre is built with Flutter and supports:
- **iOS** (Active)
- **Android** (Active)

## Key Features

- **Workout Tracker:** Log sets (warm-up, failure, dropsets), routines, and session history.
- **Calorie & Macro Tracker:** Track nutrition, hydration, and supplements with adaptive weekly guidance.
- **Bodyweight & Recovery Analytics:** Deep insights into muscle readiness, volume trends, and body measurements.
- **Next-Gen AI Meal Capture:** Capture meals from photos or text via BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) setup. Fully integrated with a holistic culinary anchor (`mealContext`) and a state-aware "Top-N Fuzzy Alternatives" SQLite matching system that prevents hallucinations. Always reviewable and self-repairing before saving.
- **Privacy & Local-First:** Data stays on device. Optional one-way health export to Apple Health and Google Health Connect.

## Privacy & Philosophy

- **No Ads. No Mandatory Account. No Analytics SDKs.**
- **Offline-First:** Your data stays local unless you explicitly choose otherwise.
- **Open-Source Transparency:** Trust through public code and understandable data flows.
- **User-Controlled AI:** Optional AI features require your own API key; no data is sent to providers without opt-in.
