# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [0.9.17] - 2026-06-01
### Added
- **iOS Keyboard Done Accessory Bar**: Implemented a custom keyboard accessory overlay bar for iOS numeric inputs, aligning a localized **"Done" / "Fertig"** button (`doneButtonLabel`) above the soft keyboard for quick dismissal.
- **Global Keyboard Tap-to-Dismiss**: Wrapped the root of the app in a global translucent `GestureDetector` that automatically closes the keyboard on tapping any non-interactive empty background space.
- **Smart Keyboard-Aware UI Hiding**: Automatically hides the "Add Exercise" floating action button (FAB) on workout tracking and routine builder screens while the keyboard is open to prevent overlapping layout issues.

### fixed
- **Supplement Backup Serialization Mismatch (#418)**: Fixed a data loss vulnerability within the data management engine where the `is_tracked` boolean attribute for supplements was dropped during export serialization. Restoring from a backup now perfectly retains the original tracking configurations across all custom supplement entries.
- **Health Connect Delayed Sleep Correction (#419)**: Overhauled the wearable data synchronization pipeline to support non-destructive upserts for modified records. Delayed sleep session adjustments and retroactive accuracy updates from Apple Health/Health Connect are now correctly captured and refreshed within a rolling 72-hour synchronization window instead of being permanently blocked by stale local database caches.
- **Health Connect Step Deduplication (#424)**: Implemented an Android native source-prioritization filter for Health Connect steps. The ingestion engine now explicitly prioritizes premium tracking origins (Google Fit / Samsung Health) and filters out multi-device telemetry to eliminate double-counted step spikes.
- **Progressive Sleep Sync & Daytime Nap Protection (#419, #424)**: Overhauled the sleep pipeline to handle progressive tracker updates sharing identical start boundaries by dynamically preserving the longest consolidated record. Introduced a localized nocturnal time-window heuristic (20:00 - 12:00) to safely isolate overnight tracking cleanups while fully preserving daytime naps from cascading deletions.
- **Offline OFF Ingestion Fluid Heuristic (#421)**: Corrected a parsing bug within the static database ingestion manager where solid foods defaulted to liquids. The mapper now strictly evaluates nutrition baseline units (100g vs 100ml) and primary category tags to enforce accurate fluid flagging.
- **EAN Master Record Custom Overrides (#423)**: Introduced a new local isolation table (`user_food_overrides`) under database schema v21. Modifying a food item now automatically triggers an execution upsert, ensuring custom user corrections dynamically take precedence over weekly static database syncs during barcode scans and searches.
- **Native iOS Barcode Scanning Overhaul (#420)**: Replaced the resource-heavy C++ FFI `flutter_zxing` engine with `qr_code_scanner_plus` to leverage Apple's hardware-accelerated AVFoundation framework via native `UiKitView`. This completely eliminates background stream rotation anomalies and zero-detection macro lens issues on iOS devices, resulting in instantaneous EAN-8/EAN-13 recognition while maintaining full FOSS compliance and preserving the custom dark-glassmorphic laser viewfinder overlay.

## [0.9.16] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- **Onboarding Legal Double-Lock**: Upgraded the initial consent screen to require explicit, separate acceptance of both the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service before entering the application.
- **Interactive Legal Navigation**: Integrated an active inline hyperlink framework within the onboarding checkboxes, allowing users to review the localized Terms of Service completely offline via the internal Markdown viewer.
- **Adaptive Exercise Creation Framework**: Enhanced the custom exercise creation pipeline by dynamically merging a comprehensive, local muscle registry with database entities. This permanently ensures that essential muscle groups absent from external APIs (such as Adductors and Forearms) are always natively available as selection chips.
- **Comprehensive Latin Nomenclature Mapping**: Integrated robust data-boundary translation wrappers to correctly map and preserve foreign API fallback nomenclature (including *Brachialis*, *Obliquus externus abdominis*, *Serratus anterior*, and *Soleus*), routing them into accurate core recovery calculations and visual coordinates.

### Changed
- **Evidence-Based Synergist Recalibration**: Adjusted the secondary/overlapping muscle workload coefficient from `0.5x` down to a sports-science-standard `0.3x` scaling multiplier within all background analytical queries, preventing artificial fatigue accumulation spikes in cumulative recovery tracking.
- **Multi-Perspective Muscle Visibility**: Removed restrictive single-view viewport constraints from the visual rendering layer, allowing dual-aspect muscle groups like Adductors and Forearms to dynamically illuminate on both the anterior (front) and posterior (back) model silhouettes.

### Fixed
- **Compliance Enforcement Gaps**: Fixed a verification vulnerability by ensuring the "Continue" button remains strictly disabled until active cryptographic acceptance tokens are verified for both distinct legal frameworks.
- **Biceps Brachii Visual Disconnect**: Resolved a structural pipeline mismatch within the local SVG template rendering framework by linking generic biceps inputs to target and color both the long-head and short-head anatomical path coordinates concurrently.
- **Anatomical Dropout and Mappings**: Patched an ingestion leak where unmapped compound muscle components were either completely discarded or misattributed to parent groups, stabilizing long-term data integrity for core training logs.

## [0.9.15] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **Interactive Anatomical Visualization**: Integrated the `flutter_body_highlighter` package across all training vectors (`RecoveryTrackerScreen`, `WorkoutSummaryScreen`, `WorkoutLogDetailScreen`, and `MuscleGroupAnalyticsScreen`).
- **Dynamic Gender Mapping**: Implemented a reactive mapping layer that automatically adapts the anatomical silhouette (Male/Female) to the user's biological preference saved in their profile.
- **Configurable AI Timeout**: Added a user-facing slider in AI Settings allowing manual adjustment of the request timeout (10s to 300s) to support variable hardware performance during local model validation.
- **Anatomical Lower Leg Tracking**: Added official support for the **Tibialis Anterior** muscle to the highlighter library and mapped it to calf training for a more accurate front-view leg highlight.
- **Full AI Provider Registry Restoration**: Restored **Google Gemini**, **xAI Grok (Grok)**, and **Mistral** back to the settings selection dropdown in `ai_settings_screen.dart` alongside OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and Custom, making all 7 supported AI providers fully selectable for on-device food analysis.

### Changed
- **Relative Heatmap Intensity**: Refactored workout heatmaps to use session-normalized intensity (1-5). The most-trained muscle in a session now always displays at maximum vibrancy, regardless of total volume.
- **Vibrant Visualization Palette**: Deployed a custom "Heat" color ramp (Yellow → Orange → Red) for workout sessions and high-contrast accents (Cyan/Green) for recovery states to maximize readability.
- **Standardized Analytics UI**: Unified the `TabBar` design across all analytics screens with consistent icons and localized labels (**Involved Muscles** and **Analysis**).
- **Sleep Scoring Engine LaTeX Refactoring**: Refactored the 3 complex multi-line `cases` equations in `sleep_scoring_engine.md` (Sleep Duration, Light Sleep Penalty, and Circadian Timing) into clear bulleted text conditions and single-line display math blocks (`$$ ... $$`). This completely bypasses markdown backslash-escaping and HTML entity conversion bugs to guarantee robust, beautifully styled green math blocks on all viewports without any KaTeX compiler crashes or text overflows.

### Fixed
- **Shoulder Highlight Bug**: Resolved a library-level mismatch between SVG path keys and enum mappings, restoring correct anterior/posterior deltoid highlights.
- **Core Tracking Gaps**: Re-enabled **Abs**, **Obliques**, and **Core** in the recovery tracking engine. Tapping "Abs" now correctly highlights the entire core region on the body model.
- **Workout Summary Scroll Lock**: Moved all summary elements into a unified `ListView`, eliminating the "tiny window" scrolling limitation on compact viewports.
- **Stale Muscle Mapping**: Fixed a state-leak bug in `WorkoutLogDetailScreen` where deleted exercises would leave "ghost" highlights on the body model.
- **Dropdown Visibility Regression**: Resolved a settings screen filter issue that inadvertently hid registered production AI providers from the user-facing settings screen.


## [0.9.14] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Embedded Technical Specifications**: Authored and integrated uncompressed, high-density mathematical engineering documents under `documentation/features/` covering the Bayesian TDEE Estimator, Hybrid BYOK AI Verification, and the newly formulated Muscle Recovery Model.
- **Dynamic Hydration Scaling**: Replaced the legacy static 3000 ml water intake default with a personalized, weight-dependent metabolic formula:
  $$\text{Daily Water (ml)} = \left(\frac{\text{Body Weight in kg}}{20}\right) \cdot 1000$$
  Integrated seamlessly across onboarding tracking vectors and active asset dashboards (`OnboardingScreen`, `GoalsScreen`).
- **Mathematical Rendering Pipeline**: Expanded dependencies in `pubspec.yaml` to include `flutter_markdown_plus_latex` and `markdown` to support native, on-device parsing of high-precision math inside modal views.
- **Interactive Web Analytics Hub**: Deployed a massive responsive update to the `docs/` architecture, featuring a premium dark-glassmorphic, interactive KaTeX-powered calculator allowing users to live-simulate Bayesian TDEE decay and process noise variance expansions ($Q = 40$).
- **Data Access Layer Extensions**: Added a specialized `getLatestWeight()` asynchronous retrieval routine within `lib/data/database_helper.dart` to safely supply active user metrics to dynamic calculation engines.

### Changed
- **Algorithmic Information Transparency**: Deployed educational info triggers (ℹ️) across four core interfaces: `RecoveryTrackerScreen`, `AiMealCaptureScreen`, `NutritionRecommendationCard`, and `SleepScoreCard` to grant users full mathematical visibility.
- **Localization Architecture Hardening**: Expanded localized string dictionaries (`app_de.arb` and `app_en.arb`) by over 20 new high-density technical prose entries. Completely purged raw LaTeX syntax and legacy academic/clinical citations from translation assets to enforce bulletproof UI rendering.

### Fixed
- **Information Screen Layout Overflows**: Refactored the `ExpansionTile` headers inside `algorithm_info_sheet.dart` into a single text-wrapped flexible row, completely eliminating right-side pixel clipping and horizontal layout breaking on compact viewports.
## [0.9.13] - 2026-05-xx

### Added
- **UI Modularization Milestone**: Completed an epic, 11-phase modularization of the core presentation layer.

  - Established a dedicated widget library for the Statistics Hub, isolating dashboard cards (Pulse, Sleep, Performance, etc.) for better maintainability.
- **Enhanced Data Layer Architecture**:
  - Decomposed the monolithic 3,100+ LOC `WorkoutLocalDataSource` into specialized part-files: `exercises_queries.dart`, `routines_queries.dart`, `workout_logging_queries.dart`, and `workout_stats_queries.dart`.
  - Isolated the mathematical engine of the Bayesian TDEE estimator into dedicated domain models (`estimator_models.dart`, `observation_model.dart`, `regression_engine.dart`).
- **Advanced Sleep Diagnostics**:
  - Deployed a continuous, on-device Sleep Continuity fallback architecture ($S_{C, fallback}$) for commercial smartwatches that do not supply explicit SE/WASO (Efficiency/Awake minutes) data, leveraging light sleep distribution ($90\%$) and total duration ($10\%$).
  - Added `multiplierBottleneck` diagnostics to `SleepScoringResult` to pinpoint the exact physiological domain limiting the sleep health index.
  - Upgraded the UI Clinical Protection Banner to dynamically fetch the bottleneck key and display precise, contextual biological explanations (tailored warnings for REM, N3, TST, or Circadian delays).

- **UI Code Optimization**: Relocated over 15,000 lines of inline UI code into structured sub-widgets, reducing core file sizes by up to 68% in critical performance paths.
- **Sleep Health Score v3.5 (SHS v3.5)**:
  - Shifted from a rigid, binary hard-cap framework (forcing scores to a flat 60/40) to the continuous, multi-domain **Sleep Health Score v3.5 (SHS v3.5)** using dynamic soft-cap multipliers (`_linear` interpolation maps).
  - Calibrated the Light Sleep Percentage Penalty ($P_{light}$) curve to real-world smartwatch limitations (blending N1 and N2) by shifting the optimal threshold to $\le 65\%$ with a precision decay standard deviation of $7.0\%$.
  - Smoothed out the Sleep Duration ($S_D$) low-end clipping boundary by completely removing the artificial $4.0\text{h}$ hard-zero floor, allowing continuous Gaussian calculation across the entire short-sleep spectrum.
- **UI Layout Cleanups**: Removed the restrictive nested Card containers from the Detail-Analyse section, turning it into a clean native Section Header with edge-to-edge, full-width `GlassProgressBar` fields.

### Fixed
- **Zero-Warning Compliance**: Resolved all remaining lint warnings and static analysis issues across the entire codebase, reaching 100% compile-time safety.
- **Code Verification**: Validated all architectural changes against the full suite of 610+ regression tests, ensuring 100% green status.

- Hardened loading and error handling across Statistics, Diary, Sleep, Pulse, AI meal save, feedback-report, and active workout flows.
- Reduced Android UI stalls and ANR risk by moving production Drift database work to a background isolate and reducing repeated database lookups.

## [0.9.0-beta.6] - 2026-05-05
### Fixed
- Fixed severe Pulse loading lag in Statistics by caching hourly heart-rate aggregates instead of repeatedly reprocessing large raw sample histories.
- Hardened Pulse aggregate cache coverage so small recent caches cannot be mistaken for complete older or larger ranges.

### Changed
- Pulse Hub summaries now use cached aggregate rows for range, average pulse, and resting-pulse estimates.
- Pulse detail charts now render from capped aggregate chart points while preserving the selected time range.

### Internal
- Added Drift persistence for hourly Pulse aggregates and aggregate metadata.
- Added regression coverage for large Pulse histories, incremental refresh, leading backfill, weighted aggregate metrics, chart point caps, and disabled tracking behavior.

## [0.9.0-beta.5] - 2025-05-05
### Fixed
- Renamed bundled and remote catalog database artifacts to Train Libre filenames while preserving legacy Hypertrack fallback compatibility.
- Added English iOS permission usage descriptions for camera, microphone, speech recognition, photo library, and Apple Health access, with German InfoPlist localization kept alongside them.
- Fixed Sleep day overview week/month loading helper wiring so analyzer, tests, and debug builds compile cleanly.
- Fixed a Diary water logging refresh issue where adding water after a refresh could trigger broad app reloads, causing lag or persistent loading states across tabs.
- Kept the selected Diary date stable when adding water from the Diary action path.

### Changed
- New installs now use Train Libre catalog database filenames by default, including `train_libre_training.db`, `train_libre_base_foods.db`, `train_libre_off_<country>.db`, and `train_libre_prep_<country>.db`.
- WGER and Open Food Facts refresh workflows/scripts now publish Train Libre database artifact filenames.
- Base-food sharing/export subjects now use the Train Libre database filename.
- activated minification so the size of the app shrinks

### Compatibility
- Existing local Hypertrack-named catalog files are migrated by copying to the Train Libre filename, verifying the copied size, and removing the old file only after verification.
- Remote catalog refresh prefers Train Libre artifact URLs and falls back to legacy Hypertrack artifact URLs when needed.
- Backup restore compatibility for legacy Hypertrack metadata and filenames remains intact.

### Internal
- Added regression coverage for Train Libre default filenames, explicit legacy fallback constants, local legacy file migration, remote fallback resolution, iOS InfoPlist permission strings, and legacy backup restore compatibility.
- Documented canonical Train Libre catalog filenames and legacy fallback behavior.

## [0.9.0-beta.4] - 2025-05-05
### Fixed
- Improved Statistics hub loading so slow or failing sections no longer block the entire tab.
- Replaced shared Statistics loading behavior with section-level stale-while-refresh state.
- Kept existing Statistics section data visible while range changes refresh in the background.
- Prevented stale async Statistics results from overwriting newer section data after rapid range changes.
- Fixed Statistics section error handling so failures remain local to the affected card instead of causing endless global loading.
- Fixed Sleep card visibility after Sleep tracking is disabled.
- Prevented in-flight Sleep and Pulse loads from re-rendering stale cards after their tracking features are disabled.
- Added missing cleanup/error handling for selected AI meal save and feedback-report actions to avoid stuck loading states.
- Improved Diary and Add Food performance by reducing repeated product and meal-total lookups.
- Fixed a Live Workout listener cleanup issue.

### Changed

- Added debug-only per-section performance timing logs for Statistics and related database/helper calls.
- Preserved Recovery as a fixed current-state metric while improving Statistics reload behavior.

### Internal
- Added regression coverage for section-level Statistics loading, stale result protection, gated Sleep/Pulse visibility, and failed load cleanup.
- Added performance diagnosis documentation for issue #313.
- Expanded focused performance/stability tests around Statistics, Add Food meal totals, product batch lookup, backup JSON processing, and save-flow loading cleanup.

## [0.9.0-beta.3] - 2025-05-05

### Fixed
- Fixed redundant Add Food meal-card refetching by caching meal total futures and using batched product lookup.
- Fixed repeated Diary product lookups by batch-loading products for the selected day.
- Fixed possible stale Statistics range results when switching range chips quickly.
- Fixed additional startup blocking by deferring non-critical initialization until after the first initializer frame.
- Moved Backup JSON encode/decode work off the main isolate to reduce UI stalls during import/export.

### Improved
- Improved Add Food meal performance during scrolling, rebuilds, and meal edits.
- Improved Diary loading performance for days with many food entries.
- Improved startup responsiveness while preserving ongoing workout restoration.
- Improved backup import/export responsiveness for larger backup files.

### Internal
- Added regression coverage for Add Food meal totals.
- Added batch product lookup coverage.
- Added backup isolate helper coverage.
- Added Statistics stale overlapping-load coverage.
- Full Flutter test suite passed with 509 tests.
- Android debug build completed successfully.

## [0.9.0-beta.2] - 2026-05-05
### Added
- Added native share-sheet support for completed workouts and routines.
- Added text exports with localized workout/routine summaries, set-type handling, workout volume, Train Libre branding, and the project GitHub link.
- Added branded image share cards for workouts and routines, including multiple workout layouts for summary, exercises, muscle focus, and minimal stats.

### Changed
- Redesigned workout text sharing to use readable per-set lines with localized special set-type suffixes.
- Redesigned routine image sharing to use compact set-type codes and two-column exercise cards with truncation and `+ X more` handling.
- Improved share-card branding by using the current Train Libre SVG logo.

### Fixed
- Moved the production Drift SQLite connection onto a background isolate to prevent database work from blocking touch handling and causing Android ANRs.
- Reduced workout-history database load by fetching completed workout sets in bulk instead of issuing one set query per workout log.
- Removed redundant food-search controller rebuilds while typing in Add Food, Food Explorer, and the general food picker.
- Prevented the Diary weight chart from reloading its database query on unrelated parent rebuilds.
- Preserved the selected Diary date after adding or logging food, meals, fluids, supplements, caffeine, measurements, AI meals, or workouts from a non-today Diary view.
- Removed a Live Workout session-manager listener on screen disposal to reduce memory-leak risk after leaving active workouts.
- Prevented dense workout and routine share cards from clipping long labels or overflowing the image canvas.
- Fixed muscle-focus share cards so high-exercise workouts keep the radar, top muscle-volume values, and footer inside the exported image.

## [0.9.0-beta.1] - 2025-05-02
### Changed
- Renamed the app and repository branding from Hypertrack to Train Libre across Flutter, Android, iOS, widgets, documentation, and package metadata.

### Fixed
- Preserved restore compatibility for legacy Hypertrack backups while creating new backups under the Train Libre name.

## [0.9.0-alpha.4] - 2026-05-02
### Fixed
- Hardened Sleep Health Score handling for ambiguous and missing stage data.
- Prevented `unknown` and ambiguous `inBedOnly` stages from inflating wake duration, WASO, interruptions, and sleep-efficiency penalties.
- Improved REM-missing and low-fidelity stage guardrails so scores do not imply unsupported certainty.
- Made Sleep Regularity Index availability depend on valid consecutive comparison pairs, not just raw valid-day count.
- Marked synthesized duration-only sleep windows as estimated instead of treating them like observed session bounds.
- Added targeted regression tests for missing-stage handling, stage guardrails, SRI coverage, and sleep-window fallback behavior.
- Improved Muscle Recovery readiness semantics with bodyweight strength support, explicit cardio exclusion, and centralized significant-load handling.
- Recalibrated recovery pressure so equivalent-set load no longer saturates after very small stimuli.
- Added muscle-specific recovery windows plus load- and intensity-based recovery extensions.
- Made RIR/RPE fatigue detection more robust and fixed inclusive recovery-state boundary behavior.
- Added robust recovery timestamp parsing and clarified fixed current-state recovery lookback behavior.
- Fixed remote OFF catalog import for currently published single-file SQLite artifacts that still use WAL header mode.
- Prevented remote catalog normalization from truncating downloaded DB files before import validation.
- Added startup retry behavior so failed remote refresh attempts bypass the normal minimum check interval on the next app launch.

### Changed
- Refined muscle recovery analytics by separating current readiness from last-load pressure in the Recovery Tracker.
- Updated recovery UI copy to show actual effective recovery windows and localized load-pressure levels.
- Improved recovery heuristic documentation for muscle-specific windows, readiness scoring, and load-pressure semantics.
- Startup loading status now reflects remote catalog preparation details during OFF/training refresh checks.

### Internal
- Expanded recovery regression coverage for equivalent-set pressure, bodyweight/cardio filtering, RIR/RPE fatigue thresholds, muscle-specific windows, boundary behavior, timestamp parsing, and recovery range policy.
- Updated statistics/recovery documentation to frame readiness as a transparent training-log heuristic rather than a clinical recovery prediction.
- Hardened remote catalog refresh services with WAL-header normalization, size-integrity guards, and focused regression coverage for OFF refresh edge cases.
- Updated OFF/WGER catalog refresh docs and generator scripts to enforce portable published SQLite artifacts (`journal_mode=DELETE`).

## [0.9.0-alpha.3] - 2026-04-26
### Internal
- updated the base nutrition database

## [0.9.0-alpha.2] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- Fixed Pulse day-scope handling so the current day is now included as a partial-day window (`start of day -> now`) instead of behaving like a fully completed 24-hour period.
- Added a small guard against zero-length Pulse day windows around local midnight rollover.
- Improved sleep heart-rate fallback behavior on Android / Health Connect setups by deriving sleep HR from the general heart-rate stream when strict sleep-session-linked heart-rate samples are unavailable.
- Improved robustness for vendor/device combinations such as Xiaomi Band setups where valid heart-rate samples may exist but are not reliably linked to sleep-session records.

### Changed
- Sleep heart-rate fallback now intersects general heart-rate samples with imported sleep-session time windows and remaps matched samples to the corresponding sleep session before use.
- The fallback path is still conservative: strict session-linked sleep HR remains preferred, and derived-by-window HR is only used when that stricter result is empty.

### Internal
- Added focused regression tests for:
  - Pulse current-day partial-window behavior
  - Health Connect sleep-HR derivation from general HR samples filtered by sleep windows

### Notes
- This release is a targeted reliability follow-up to `0.9.0-alpha.1`.
- Real-device validation remains especially important for Xiaomi Band / Health Connect combinations and for edge cases such as overlapping or adjacent sleep sessions.

## [0.9.0-alpha.1] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- Added opt-in Pulse analysis with a Settings toggle, heart-rate permission request, and a Statistics hub entry that appears only when enabled.
- Added a dedicated Pulse analysis screen with day/week/month period controls, pulse range, time-weighted average pulse, conservative resting-pulse estimate, and the existing line-chart pattern.
- Added a shared deterministic AI meal validation engine for capture and recommendations, including local DB matching quality, local nutrition recomputation, target-fit checks, visible warnings, and bounded repair orchestration.
- Added a separate opt-in setting for sending recent meal context to AI meal recommendations. It defaults off and recommendations still work without it.

### Fixed
- Improved Android sleep heart-rate retrieval for Health Connect providers that store valid in-session samples inside longer heart-rate records whose record window can sit outside the strict sleep/import window.
- Made AI meal save behavior explicit when some recognized/recommended items are unmatched, so partial saves no longer look like all AI items were saved.

### Changed
- Updated Apple Health usage copy to mention enabled health views that read steps, sleep, and heart-rate data.
- AI meal recommendations now locally verify kcal/protein/carbs/fat fit against the intended remaining meal target before acceptance, with up to three automatic repair passes.
- AI meal capture now validates recognized quantities, DB matches, and recomputed nutrition before showing the review screen, with up to three automatic repair passes.

### Internal
- Modernized the Android app module Java/Kotlin compile target from 8 to 17 to match the current Gradle/AGP/JDK toolchain and reduce app-owned build warnings.
- Replaced the foreground rest-timer sound cue with Flutter's built-in system alert sound and removed the `flutter_ringtone_player` dependency to eliminate its Android Java 8/deprecated API build warnings.
- Documented the Pulse MVP boundaries and the Health Connect sleep HR fallback behavior.
- Documented the AI meal capture/recommendation validation architecture and added focused validation/repair tests.

### Notes
- The former `flutter_ringtone_player` warning source was reviewed: version 4.0.0+4 still declares Java 8 compatibility and uses the deprecated Android `Ringtone.setStreamType(...)` API. The app only used it for the foreground rest-timer notification sound, so replacing that single call was lower-risk than keeping or suppressing the plugin warning.

## [0.8.11] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- Improved workout heart-rate retrieval reliability for vendor-originated Health Connect data by adding a safe fallback query window when the strict workout window returns no records.
- Restored the missing Measurements shortcut on the Statistics hub so body measurements are reachable again from the Body section.

### Changed
- Continued the Settings IA cleanup with a conservative extraction pass:
  - moved Appearance settings into a dedicated sub-screen
  - moved Steps settings into a dedicated sub-screen
  - moved Sleep settings into a dedicated sub-screen
  - kept Health export in its dedicated sub-screen for consistent structure
- Reorganized top-level Settings into broader sections for better scanability:
  - App
  - Health & Tracking
  - Nutrition & Data
  - Support / About
- Moved “Restart app tour” to the bottom of the App section.
- Refined a few Settings entry icons for better visual consistency.

### Notes
- This release focuses on low-risk UX structure improvements and targeted compatibility fixes without changing settings persistence semantics.

## [0.8.10] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- Improved backup/restore robustness so malformed or legacy-shaped payload rows no longer abort the full import as easily.
- Hardened supplement settings/history restore handling for legacy ID mappings and more tolerant type parsing.
- Improved body/nutrition trend loading stability so outdated async responses no longer overwrite newer range selections.
- Prevented malformed analytics chart inputs from causing unstable rendering in normalized trend charts.
- Reduced small-screen layout issues in the body/nutrition trend legend by switching to a wrapping layout.
- Reduced the risk of synthetic workout-session ID collisions in edge cases.

### Improved
- Polished the body/nutrition drill-down fallback state with clearer empty/error messaging.
- Improved resilience of health-step-segment restore by sanitizing malformed rows before database upsert.
- Replaced remaining raw debug print behavior in workout session restore with safer debug logging.

### Notes
- This release focuses on stability, restore safety, analytics robustness, and small UI polish improvements.

## [0.8.9] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Reworked the **Bodyweight ↔ Calorie analytics feature** from a simple correlation approach to a more robust **trend-summary model**.
- Replaced correlation-style interpretation with clearer classification of observed patterns:
  - cut-like (lower intake + falling weight)
  - bulk-like (higher intake + rising weight)
  - maintenance-like (stable/stable)
  - mixed or unclear signals
- Improved wording and interpretation to avoid overconfident or misleading conclusions and emphasize non-causality.
- Reused the weekly sleep-window chart pattern in the Sleep regularity detail view for more consistent sleep-timing visualization and reduced duplicated chart logic.

### Added
- Introduced a **normalized dual-line trend chart** (weight + calories) where both series start at the same baseline, making relative trend comparison significantly clearer.
- Added explicit **confidence levels** (`high`, `moderate`, `low`, `insufficient`) based on data quality.
- Added **data-quality diagnostics**, including coverage, overlap, and gap awareness, to support more honest insights.
- Added workout heart-rate summaries and charts to make already recorded heart-rate data visible after training.
- Added basic workout heart-rate metrics including average, maximum, and minimum heart rate where data is available.
- Added a dedicated heart-rate section to the workout detail screen with a session heart-rate line chart.
- Added a compact heart-rate summary block to the post-workout summary screen.

### Improved
- Significantly strengthened **data sufficiency and quality gating**:
  - minimum time span and data coverage requirements
  - overlap validation between weight and calorie logs
  - gap penalties and noise handling
- Redesigned the **Statistics hub Body & Nutrition card**:
  - clearer quick-scan summary
  - compact trend labels and relationship classification
  - embedded normalized mini chart
  - explicit confidence and data basis indicators (e.g. number of weigh-ins and logged days)
- Reworked the **Body & Nutrition detail screen**:
  - replaced separate charts with a single combined normalized comparison chart
  - simplified and clarified the interpretation section
  - removed the body-measurements shortcut to reduce visual noise and improve focus
- Added workout heart-rate data-quality handling with clearer fallback states for missing, sparse, or limited samples.
- Reused existing health-platform data flows with lightweight workout-window matching instead of introducing a heavier persistence layer for the MVP.

### Fixed
- Eliminated misleading or weak “correlation” outputs in sparse or noisy datasets.
- Reduced risk of overinterpreting incomplete or low-quality data by enforcing stricter gating and clearer fallback states.

### Notes
- This feature focuses on **trend context, not causal inference**.  
  Observed relationships between calorie intake and bodyweight should be interpreted as patterns, not direct cause-effect conclusions.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Completed a repo-wide UI consistency pass for app-owned alerts by migrating remaining standard `AlertDialog` flows to the existing Hypertrack glass action-sheet/dialog component.
- Migrated save/confirm/action dialogs in key flows:
  - onboarding restore password prompt
  - post-onboarding app-tour offer
  - AI key-missing prompts (capture + recommendation)
  - nutrition edit dialogs (food + fluid) and fluid delete confirmation
  - settings OFF region picker and attribution/licenses dialog
  - data import success acknowledgment in Data Management
- Extended the shared custom dialog helper with optional strict modal behavior (`isDismissible` / `enableDrag`) for critical confirmation flows.

### Fixed
- Removed remaining app-level default alert style mismatches in migrated screens so action dialogs now follow one consistent Hypertrack UI pattern.
- Preserved existing action semantics and async handling across migrated flows (confirm/cancel/save/delete outcomes unchanged).

### Internal
- Cleaned up remaining analyzer issues, including widget constructor keys, naming consistency, model API cleanup, and minor test/dev code refactors.

### Notes
- Intentionally kept native-style blocking loading overlays (spinner dialogs used during workout-start operations) unchanged, since these are progress overlays rather than app decision dialogs.

## [0.8.7] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Added a short optional post-onboarding app tour with spotlight/coach-mark guidance through the main app structure.
- Added a Settings entry to restart the app tour at any time.

### Changed
- Polished app-tour coach-mark positioning to keep the explanation panel clear of the bottom navigation area while preserving anchor context.
- Refreshed the app icon for this release.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Added an optional, user-triggered feedback/diagnostic report flow in Settings:
  - local report generation only (no automatic upload or hidden submission)
  - explicit preview before any sharing action
  - explicit actions: copy, save temporary `.txt`, share via native sheet, or open prefilled email draft to `feedback@schotte.me`
  - optional section toggles for adaptive nutrition diagnostics, backup/restore diagnostics, and user note

### Changed
- Reordered top-level Settings sections for a clearer flow:
  - Appearance
  - Diary
  - AI Meal Capture
  - Steps
  - Sleep
  - Health export
  - Data backup & import
  - Food database
  - Support
  - About & legal

## [0.8.5] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Added Open Food Facts multi-country refresh/distribution infrastructure with dedicated country channels:
  - `off-foods-de-stable`
  - `off-foods-us-stable`
  - `off-foods-uk-stable`
- Added country-specific OFF release artifacts and metadata pipeline:
  - `hypertrack_off_<country>.db`
  - `off_build_report_<country>.json`
  - `off_catalog_manifest_<country>.json`
  - `off_diff_report_<country>.json`
  - `off_release_notes_<country>.md`
- Added OFF helper scripts for workflow robustness and maintainability:
  - `off_catalog_diff.py`
  - `resolve_off_reference_manifest.py`
  - `build_off_catalog_manifest.py`
  - `build_off_release_notes.py`
  - `publish_off_run_summary.py`
- Added OFF country-aware remote adoption service and startup integration:
  - `OffCatalogRefreshService`
  - `BasisDataManager` OFF remote-candidate adoption with safe fallback behavior
- Added user-facing settings UI for selecting the active food database region:
  - Germany (DE)
  - United States (US)
  - United Kingdom (UK)

### Changed
- OFF catalog generation is now explicitly country-parameterized and bulk-parquet based (`create_off_food_db.py` CLI).
- OFF manifest contract was formalized with integrity + safety fields:
  - `source_id`, `country_code`, `channel`, `version`
  - `db_sha256`
  - `product_count` (informational)
  - `min_product_count` (hard validation floor)
- OFF diff baseline strategy now compares against previous published release assets per country channel (not repository baseline files).
- OFF installed-version tracking moved to country-scoped keys (`installed_off_version_<country>`), with legacy migration safety for existing DE installs.
- Settings flow now clearly communicates that OFF region changes are applied through the existing next refresh/import cycle.

### Fixed
- Hardened OFF startup safety when bundle and remote are unavailable for a selected country: imports are skipped safely without destructive side effects.
- Preserved historical nutrition continuity under OFF region/catalog changes by keeping `off` + `off_retained` semantics intact.

### Notes
- The bundled DE OFF database fallback remains intentionally included for staged rollout safety.
- Supported OFF app regions in this release are DE, US, and UK.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Added end-to-end remote exercise catalog refresh channel using release assets (`wger-catalog-stable`) with app-side adoption flow.
- Added dedicated catalog artifacts and supporting reports (`wger_build_report.json`, `wger_diff_report.json`, manifest).
- Added helper scripts for workflow robustness:
  - `build_wger_catalog_manifest.py`
  - `resolve_wger_reference_manifest.py`
  - `build_wger_release_notes.py`
  - `publish_wger_run_summary.py`
- Added regression tests for exercise catalog ID-upsert semantics and historical workout restoration under catalog drift.

### Changed
- Catalog refresh now uses stricter manifest contract and validation rules (source/channel/version/url checks).
- Threshold semantics were clarified and enforced:
  - `expected_exercise_count` is informational
  - `min_exercise_count` / minimum rows is the hard validation floor.
- Diff baseline logic now compares against the previously published release asset DB (not the committed repository DB baseline).
- Workflow hardening for scheduled/manual refresh + channel publication, including safer gating and artifact handling.
- App-side exercise base import now uses non-destructive `ON CONFLICT(id) DO UPDATE` behavior for catalog rows.
- Workout detail/summary/session restore paths now resolve exercises by stored `exercise_id` first, with graceful fallback.

### Fixed
- Fixed potential aggressive refresh behavior by avoiding replace-style writes for base exercises.
- Fixed a history integrity risk where session restore could lose blocks if exercise names changed after catalog update.
- Fixed set-log update behavior to preserve existing `exercise_id` linkage when name lookup no longer matches.
- Preserved historical usability when exercise rows are missing by preventing silent loss in restore flows.

### Internal / Tooling
- Hardened workflow implementation by moving fragile inline scripting to dedicated Python utilities.
- Improved release-channel publication plumbing and run-summary diagnostics.
- Updated catalog refresh documentation to match current non-destructive import semantics and release-asset distribution model.

### Notes
- Existing workout logs continue to resolve via stable exercise IDs where present; metadata updates for the same ID are reflected.
- Upstream-removed exercises are preserved locally (no hard-delete sweep in refresh path), maintaining history integrity and selector availability for retained rows.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-04-12

### Removed
- Removed the complete home-screen widget feature from MVP scope on all platforms (Flutter, Android, iOS).
- Removed Android app-widget provider/resources and iOS WidgetKit extension target integration.
- Removed widget-specific app startup, deep-link launcher, and shared widget bridge/config plumbing.

### Changed
- Regenerated app localizations after removing widget-only translation keys.
- Cleaned release notes/changelog references tied only to the removed widget rollout.

### Fixed
- Restored reliable iOS simulator install/runtime by removing broken app-extension integration from the app build.
- Preserved and kept active the Measurements deletion persistence fix (including legacy timestamp fallback behavior).

## [0.8.3-alpha.2] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- Refined **Today in Focus** widget density and spacing on both iOS and Android to reduce wasted space and show more useful data in the same widget area.
- Improved small-widget layout behavior on iOS with tighter typography and padding, allowing more compact metric presentation.
- Improved Android widget row sizing, spacing, and adaptive visibility logic so medium/large widget sizes can display more metrics.

### Fixed
- Fixed measurement deletion persistence in the Measurements screen: swiping to delete now removes the session from storage, not only from the current UI state.
- Hardened measurement-session deletion for legacy records by adding a timestamp-based fallback when legacy session IDs are missing.

## [0.8.3-alpha.1] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- Added a first alpha version of the new **Today in Focus** home-screen widget.
- Widget supports configurable daily metrics such as calories, protein, water, carbohydrates, sugar, fat, caffeine, creatine, supplements, steps, workouts, and sleep.
- Added widget configuration support for visible metric selection and maximum visible item count.
- Added widget tap behavior to open the app directly into the Diary / Tagebuch flow.
- Added a new **Haptic feedback** setting, enabled by default.

### Changed
- Finalized the app’s haptic feedback behavior through a centralized, settings-aware feedback layer.
- Added lightweight confirmation haptics for meaningful completion actions such as saving, adding, applying, starting, and finishing.
- Preserved existing haptic behavior for tab switching, FAB interactions, chart-point dragging, and timer completion flows.
- Added subtle AI waiting haptics during active generation/loading states.

### Fixed
- Fixed missing confirmation haptics on important add/save actions in several key flows.
- Fixed AI waiting haptics so they stop correctly when generation finishes and no longer continue into review/result screens.
- Refined the AI waiting haptic pattern to feel more periodic and less abrupt.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-04-10

### Changed
- Reorganized the Workout, Statistics, and Nutrition hub screens to better separate training actions, analytics, and nutrition tools.
- Updated hub section structure and ordering to reduce overlap and make navigation clearer.
- Workout hub now focuses on starting training, managing routines, and accessing workout history / exercise library.
- Nutrition hub now groups adaptive recommendation, goals, meals, and nutrition tools more clearly.
- Statistics hub now groups content into Steps, Recovery, Training, and Body sections.

### Fixed
- Removed redundant hub entries that added clutter without meaningful functionality.
- Fixed remaining localization regressions from the hub reorganization by replacing hardcoded Statistics UI strings with proper l10n usage.
- Standardized uppercase section-header rendering across the reorganized hub screens.
- Ensured hub entry labels and section names are consistently localized in German and English.
## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- Improved sleep day-view timeline readability with clearer timestamp labels, better spacing, and stronger light/dark-mode contrast.
- Corrected the weekly sleep-window chart so displayed time bounds and axis labels better match actual sleep session timing, including cross-midnight sessions.
- Sleep scoring now applies conservative stage-aware guardrails so mostly-light or REM-missing nights (especially from limited-fidelity sources such as Withings) cannot silently receive near-perfect totals.
- Depth-related sleep feedback now better reflects light-dominant nights instead of relying on deep-sleep percentage alone.

### Changed
- Weekly sleep-window aggregation now prefers canonical session start/end bounds when available, instead of relying only on derived duration placement.
- Sleep scoring pipeline now passes stage mix, timeline confidence, and source metadata into the score calculation.

### Internal
- Added targeted regression coverage for:
  - sleep day-view timeline timestamp rendering
  - weekly sleep-window axis bounds and cross-midnight behavior
  - stage-aware sleep score guardrails
  - limited-source / missing-REM scoring behavior
  - repository propagation of canonical session start/end times

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- User-facing maintenance uncertainty range and stabilization hints on adaptive recommendation surfaces.
- Canonical adaptive diet-phase tracking (`cut`/`maintain`/`bulk`) with deterministic 7-day confirmation for phase changes.

### Changed
- Adaptive nutrition recommendation now ships as a canonical Bayesian recursive system with explicit manual apply workflow.
- Adaptive recommendation observation scaling now uses confirmed-phase-age ramping (`3000 -> 7700` kcal/kg through week 9+) instead of window-length scaling.
- Generation semantics remain due-week anchored and deterministic within a due week, including force-recalculation replay behavior.
- Due-notification eligibility is strictly gated by due-week status, generated-state status, and notification-state status.

### Fixed
- Hardened adaptive recommendation persistence with coherent snapshot/state checks, legacy fallback migration handling, and recovery from malformed canonical keys.
- Ensured backup/restore continuity for adaptive recommendation settings and canonical recursive state persistence.

### Internal
- Expanded adaptive nutrition regression coverage across domain/data/presentation/scenario layers, including long-horizon simulations, phase-transition scenarios, and backup/restore continuity validation.

### Acknowledgements
- Thanks to @Whatsonyourmind for thoughtful review and feedback on the adaptive nutrition model, uncertainty presentation, and edge-case framing during the 0.8.0 development cycle.

## [0.8.0-alpha.3-bayesian-preview.3] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- Canonical adaptive diet-phase model (`cut`, `maintain`, `bulk`) with persisted confirmed/pending phase tracking.
- Deterministic 7-day phase-change confirmation flow:
  - pending candidate starts on direction change
  - confirmed phase switches only after 7 stable days
  - reverting before confirmation cancels pending reset
- Lightweight residual-bias diagnostic seam for weekly observation validation:
  - mean residual summary
  - sample count
  - bias direction status (`neutral`, likely over/under-estimating energy density)

### Changed
- Replaced the window-length kcal/kg observation scaling with confirmed-phase-age ramping:
  - week 1 = `3000`
  - linear ramp to week 9 = `7700`
  - week 9+ stays at `7700`
- Exact target-rate changes no longer define new adaptive phases; only goal direction does.
- Adaptive recommendation copy (EN/DE) now uses simpler wording that clearly separates:
  - “still adapting/settling”
  - normal uncertainty around likely maintenance range
- Adaptive nutrition current-state docs updated for confirmed-phase semantics, ramp behavior, and residual diagnostics seam.

### Testing
- Expanded adaptive nutrition scenario-test infrastructure with reusable synthetic-truth and recovery metrics helpers:
  - convergence milestones (initial / week-4 / week-8 / week-12)
  - signed/absolute error progression
  - error half-life and settling-time checks
  - bounded overshoot/undershoot and truth-crossing checks
  - pre/event/post recovery-window summaries for posterior, variance, and confidence
  - bounded weeks-to-recover checks for transient event scenarios
- Strengthened ground-truth scenario assertions to validate quantitative convergence behavior, not only boundedness/stability.
- Strengthened chaotic scenario assertions (weekend spikes, refeed, water jump, illness, logging-quality phases) to validate measurable disruption and recovery behavior.
- Added comparative long-horizon profile validation (8–12 week style horizons) with directional plausibility checks across matched profile pairs:
  - heavier vs lighter
  - lean vs higher body-fat at comparable size
  - high vs low activity
  - male/female/unknown plausibility banding
  - high-steps vs low-steps long-horizon relation

## [0.8.0-alpha.3-bayesian-preview.2] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- Data-calibrated Bayesian noise adaptation for adaptive nutrition:
  - bounded history-informed scaling for `Q` (maintenance drift variance)
  - bounded history-informed scaling for `R` (observation variance)
  - deterministic fallback to conservative defaults when history is insufficient
- User-facing maintenance uncertainty transparency:
  - likely maintenance range derived from posterior uncertainty (`mean ± 1σ`)
  - plain-language uncertainty hints on adaptive recommendation surfaces
  - stabilization hint when the recursive estimate is still settling
- Stabilization sanity-check layer derived from live vs steady-state behavior:
  - quality flags for bootstrap/transient/noisy regimes
  - conservative confidence guard during settling phases
- Expanded Bayesian estimator/service/repository/UI tests for:
  - calibration responsiveness and bounds
  - fallback safety under sparse history
  - stabilization flags and onboarding stabilization copy
  - maintenance estimate/state persistence coherence

### Changed
- Adaptive nutrition current-state docs were updated for production-style clarity, including:
  - data-calibrated `Q/R` semantics
  - credible-interval presentation semantics
  - stabilization/sanity-check behavior
  - user-facing behavior
  - scheduling and stable data-window semantics
  - recursive Bayesian prediction/update chaining
  - apply vs recalculate behavior
  - persistence and due-notification semantics
  - confidence/warning interpretation
- The nutrition recommendation card and onboarding preview now include maintenance range + uncertainty/stabilization copy without changing explicit apply semantics.
- README documentation navigation label was tightened to reflect canonical Bayesian architecture wording.

### Internal
- Adaptive nutrition terminology and inline comments were normalized further around recursive Bayesian, uncertainty, and due-week semantics.

## [0.8.0-alpha.3-bayesian-preview.1] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Experimental Bayesian/Kalman adaptive nutrition estimation path
- Atomic Bayesian experimental snapshot persistence
- Manual “Recalculate now” action for adaptive recommendations
- Recommendation freshness metadata in UI:
  - calculated at
  - next adaptive recommendation due
  - due now indicator
- Scheduler-based due-notification seam for new adaptive recommendations
- Richer estimator comparison/debug tracing
- Documented Bayesian estimator tuning parameters

### Changed
- Bayesian experimental state now uses atomic snapshot persistence as unified state storage
- Due-notification logic now requires:
  - recommendation is currently due
  - no recommendation has yet been generated for that due week
  - no notification has yet been sent for that due week
- Snapshot generation time is now sourced only from `recommendation.generatedAt`
- German adaptive notification strings now use proper umlauts and cleaner wording
- Manual recalculation now forces immediate regeneration without auto-applying active goals

### Fixed
- Safer handling of incoherent or corrupt Bayesian experimental state
- Safer migration from legacy fragmented Bayesian persistence
- Removed remaining active use of fragmented Bayesian write paths in normal experimental flow

### Internal
- Production heuristic recommendation path remains unchanged and authoritative
- Legacy fragmented Bayesian keys are now migration-only fallback support
- Documentation reviewed and updated to match final enforced behavior
## [0.8.0-alpha.2] - 2026-04-06

This alpha improves the adaptive nutrition recommendation MVP with more conservative sparse-data behavior, more robust trend estimation, better step-prior maintenance inputs, and clearer recommendation transparency.

### Added
- Recommendation transparency copy layer shared across onboarding and nutrition hub surfaces.
- New data-basis hint messaging for:
  - profile/prior-only recommendations
  - sparse recent weight logs
  - sparse recent intake logs
  - sparse weight + intake logs together
- New specific warning copy for macro-constrained recommendations.

### Changed
- `notEnoughData` recommendations are now strictly prior-only:
  - no inferred-maintenance blending
  - no week-over-week maintenance drift against previous recommendations
  - goal-rate calorie adjustment still applies on top of the prior estimate
- Prior maintenance estimation now uses step input with the following precedence:
  1. recent average actual daily steps
  2. configured daily step target
  3. fallback default of `8000`
- Recent actual step averages now use synced step data from the rolling lookback window when available.
- Weight-trend estimation now uses linear regression over EWMA-smoothed bodyweight data instead of endpoint-only delta.
- Recommendation surfaces now frame confidence as **data basis quality** rather than scientific certainty.
- Onboarding adaptive recommendation preview now shows:
  - data basis label
  - data basis counts
  - explicit prior-only messaging when applicable
  - prioritized warning text aligned with the nutrition hub card
- Recommendation warning prioritization is now more explicit:
  - calorie floor applied
  - unresolved food calories
  - large adjustment detected
  - macro distribution constrained
  - generic conservative fallback only when no more specific warning applies
- EN/DE adaptive recommendation wording was revised to match the new semantics and transparency model.

### Fixed
- Prevented sparse-data recommendations from drifting maintenance estimates despite explicitly insufficient adaptive data.
- Reduced sensitivity of weekly trend estimation to noisy start/end bodyweight values.
- Improved recommendation copy so unresolved food-calorie issues are surfaced more clearly before apply.
- Fixed onboarding progress/button logic so the final onboarding page cleanly exposes the finish action.

### Documentation
- Updated the adaptive nutrition recommendation current-state documentation to match implementation truth for:
  - strict prior-only `notEnoughData` behavior
  - regression-based weight slope calculation
  - step-priority precedence (`actual -> target -> default 8000`)
  - compact prioritized basis/warning messaging
  - continued treatment of extra cardio as a coarse manual heuristic

### Testing
- Added and updated automated tests for:
  - strict prior-only engine behavior
  - actual-steps vs target-steps fallback precedence
  - regression-based weight trend calculation
  - prior-only UI messaging
  - unresolved-food warning rendering
  - onboarding preview transparency
  - final onboarding-page finish behavior

### Notes
- Extra cardio remains a manual heuristic input and is not backed by a dedicated cardio-tracking model.
- Recent actual step averages currently use usable logged days only within the lookback window.

## [0.8.0-alpha.1] - 2026-04-06

This alpha introduces the first end-to-end MVP of adaptive nutrition recommendations.

### Added
- Adaptive weekly nutrition recommendation foundation:

  - recommendation input adapter
  - recommendation engine
  - orchestration service
- Nutrition hub recommendation card integration with:
  - confidence + warning display

- Onboarding adaptive recommendation flow with:
  - dedicated goal/rate/activity/cardio setup
  - dedicated optional body-fat onboarding step
  - body-fat guidance entry point with text-based male/female reference helper
- Goals screen recommendation settings for:
  - bodyweight goal direction
  - weekly target rate
  - baseline daily activity
  - extra cardio/endurance outside the app
- New adaptive recommendation persistence keys in `SharedPreferences` for settings/state snapshots.

### Changed
- Onboarding order is now:
  - Welcome
  - Profile
  - Bodyweight
  - Body fat %
  - Adaptive goal/recommendation settings
  - Calories
  - Macros
  - Water
- Baseline activity model expanded from 3 to 4 levels:
  - low
  - moderate
  - high
  - very high
- Activity-level helper UX is now structured and easier to scan (intro + one line per level), and remains separate from extra-cardio input.
- Prior maintenance estimation is now more personalized for MVP:
  - uses body-fat/lean-mass-aware path when body-fat % is available
  - falls back safely when body-fat is missing
  - applies declared baseline activity + extra-cardio influence conservatively
- Recommendation generation is stable per due week (no in-week drift from Monday vs later-week app-open timing).
- Recommendation-related EN/DE strings were moved/expanded in l10n and regenerated.

### Fixed
- Prevented implausible calorie outputs from being surfaced without explicit constrained/warning handling.
- Hardened calorie-input aggregation paths to reduce systematic undercounting in common logging scenarios.
- Ensured backup/restore explicitly covers adaptive recommendation settings:
  - `adaptive_nutrition_recommendation.prior_activity_level`
  - `adaptive_nutrition_recommendation.extra_cardio_hours`

### Testing
- Added and updated automated tests for:
  - recommendation domain logic
  - recommendation persistence/state behavior
  - due-week stability behavior
  - onboarding/goals recommendation flows
  - backup/restore coverage for adaptive recommendation keys

## [0.7.10] - 2026-04-05

This release includes a fix for Diary refresh behavior after saving meals through the AI meal-recognition flow.

### Fixed
- Fixed a Diary refresh issue after saving meals via the AI meal-recognition flow
  - when a meal was recognized with AI and saved from the Add Food flow, the Diary screen did not always refresh automatically
  - the save result is now propagated correctly so the Diary reloads immediately after the meal is saved
  - no manual pull-to-refresh is needed in that flow anymore

### Notes
- This fix specifically addresses the Diary → Add Food → AI meal recognition path
- The direct AI recommendation save flow already propagated refresh correctly
## [0.7.9] - 2026-04-07

  - xAI

## [0.7.6] - 2026-04-04

This release focuses on a small set of quality-of-life improvements across AI meal capture, measurements, workout logging, iOS navigation behavior, and rest timer alerts.

### Improved

- **AI meal capture UI**
  - Removed the dedicated in-app microphone button from the AI meal recognition screen
  - Moved camera and gallery actions directly into the main text input area for a cleaner and more focused layout
  - Preserved the existing prompt + image-based analysis flow

- **Measurements screen defaults**
  - The measurements chart now defaults to **weight** when weight data is available
  - Existing fallback behavior remains unchanged when weight is not present

- **Workout logging inputs**
  - Reps, weight, and related workout input fields are no longer prefilled with `0`, `0kg`, or similar zero-value defaults when unset
  - Empty fields now remain truly empty until the user enters data, while existing hint/subtext behavior is preserved

- **iOS navigation consistency**
  - Improved swipe-back behavior on iOS for settings-related navigation paths
  - Preserved explicit settings result propagation for cases where values actually changed

- **Pause timer completion alerts**

  - full-history initial export
  - incremental follow-up export
  - per-domain checkpoint behavior
  - retry-safe idempotent export bookkeeping
  - chunked export handling for larger histories
- **Timezone handling**
  - export uses source event offsets where available instead of forcing UTC everywhere
- **Diagnostics**
  - clearer export failure summaries
  - better distinction between app-side write problems and downstream platform display limitations

### Fixed

- Removed the previous effective **30-day export cap** for initial health export flows
- Fixed multiple **Health Connect write-path issues**, including:
  - invalid equal start/end intervals
  - body-fat export handling
  - nutrition/hydration write stability
  - quota-related write behavior through safer batching
- Fixed incremental export behavior so a failed domain does not unnecessarily force all other domains back into broad reload behavior
- Fixed remaining sleep-module localization gaps
- Fixed several sleep navigation / presentation rough edges found during beta testing

### Documentation

- Added / updated:
  - sleep current-state documentation
  - sleep health score v2 documentation
  - one-way health export documentation
  - overview / architecture / storage references

- Reduced outdated or duplicate sleep documentation in favor of clearer canonical sources

### Notes

- **Sleep export/import scope remains unchanged**: the sleep module is about processing and analytics inside Hypertrack, not external sleep write-back.
- **Health export is one-way only**. Hypertrack remains the authoritative record.
- **Nutrition export is aggregate-based only**. No ingredient or individual food-item reconstruction is exported.
- **Workout export is session-level only**. Internal workout structure is not exported as structured native workout data.
- Some downstream behavior, especially in **Google Fit**, may differ from what is actually stored in **Health Connect**. If a field is written correctly but not surfaced there, that is a downstream display limitation rather than a Hypertrack write failure.

## [0.7.4-beta.1] - 2026-04-04

This beta focuses on **one-way health platform export** and the final stabilization work around that integration.

### Added
- **One-way health export** from Hypertrack to:
  - **Apple Health (HealthKit)**
  - **Google Health Connect**
- Export support for:
  - **Body measurements** (for example weight, body fat where supported)
  - **Nutrition aggregates** (calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sugar, salt/sodium mapping)
  - **Hydration**
  - **Workout sessions**
- New **Health Export** settings section with:
  - per-platform enable/disable
  - permission handling
  - export status visibility
  - manual export trigger

### Improved
- **Health export reliability**
  - initial export can backfill the full history
  - follow-up exports are incremental
  - idempotent export tracking prevents duplicate writes
  - export runs are chunked for safer large-history syncs
- **Workout export quality**
  - improved workout title handling
  - workout export now includes description text plus a compact plain-text set summary where supported
- **Timezone handling**
  - export now uses source event offsets where available instead of forcing UTC in all cases
- **Diagnostics**
  - more accurate domain-level export failure summaries
  - better distinction between app-side export problems and downstream platform display limitations

### Fixed
- Removed the previous effective **30-day export limit** for initial export flows
- Fixed multiple **Health Connect write-path issues** around:
  - invalid record intervals
  - body-fat export handling
  - nutrition/hydration export stability
  - quota-related write behavior via safer batching
- Fixed incremental export behavior so one failed domain does not force unnecessary full-history reloads for all other domains

### Notes
- Export remains **one-way only**. Hypertrack is the authoritative record.
- Nutrition export remains **aggregate-based only**. No ingredient- or food-item reconstruction is exported.
- Workout export remains **session-level only**. Internal workout structure is not exported as native structured workout content.
- Some downstream display behavior, especially in **Google Fit**, may differ from what is stored in Health Connect. If a field is written correctly but not shown in Google Fit, this is a platform display limitation rather than a Hypertrack write failure.

### Documentation
- Added and updated implementation-focused documentation for the one-way health export module
- Updated project docs and overview references to reflect the current health export behavior
## [0.7.4-alpha.1] - 2026-04-03

This alpha focuses on one-way health export hardening for Android Health Connect and adds richer session context for workout exports without expanding structured workout scope.

### Added
- Workout export note-summary text built from logged exercises/sets and attached to exported workout sessions.
- Standardized set-line note formatting for export summaries:
  - one line per exercise,
  - set entries as `<setType> <weight>kg x <reps>`,
  - set-type abbreviations `W` (warm-up), `S` (standard), `F` (failure), `D` (dropset).
- Android Health Connect workout export now writes the summary to `ExerciseSessionRecord.notes`.
- Apple Health workout export now persists the summary in workout metadata (`hypertrack_workout_summary`).

### Changed
- Health export workout payload model now includes an optional notes field for platform writers.
- Workout export data loading now includes associated set logs to build ordered note summaries.
- Nutrition/Hydration grouped export flow now records split diagnostics so failures can indicate whether nutrition and hydration failed independently.

### Fixed
- Android body-fat export mapping now recognizes real stored measurement type variants (including `fat_percent`) so body-fat entries are no longer dropped before write.
- Android body-fat export normalization/range handling aligned to Health Connect `BodyFatRecord` percent expectations (`0..100`).
- Android nutrition export reliability improved:
  - strict interval validation now respected (`startTime < endTime`),
  - defensive per-field sanitization for calories/macros/fiber/sugar/sodium,
  - optional-field fallback retry to isolate problematic nutrition fields.

- Android BMI export no longer reports false-success when unsupported by the current Health Connect writer path.

### Tests
- Expanded health-export data source tests to validate workout summary note formatting and ordering across multiple exercises/sets.
- Maintained passing targeted export tests for data source, service orchestration, and adapters.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-04-03

This stable release includes all `0.7.3-alpha.*` and `0.7.3-beta.1` changes since `0.7.2`, with Sleep moved from early alpha foundations to a release-ready implementation baseline.

### Added
- End-to-end Sleep tracking across iOS (HealthKit) and Android (Health Connect), including sessions, stages, and overnight heart-rate ingestion.

  - permissions/adapters and sync service behavior
  - navigation and settings flows
  - sleep scoring engine and regularity index
  - nightly-analysis persistence and pipeline processing
  - heart-rate baseline chronology
  - forced recompute behavior
  - automatic import throttling behavior

## [0.7.3-beta.1] - 2026-04-03

This release promotes the current Sleep feature set from alpha toward beta by finalizing score behavior, settings labeling, timeline presentation, and import orchestration. Sleep scoring is now stricter for short duration nights (V2), settings labels are language-correct and no longer marked as alpha/batch, and sleep import now supports both all-time manual backfill and recurring incremental sync behavior.

### Added
- Sleep Health Score V2 as the new canonical scoring model (`sleep-health-score-v2`) with updated documentation and regression coverage.
- Automatic throttled sleep import orchestration (`importRecentIfDue`) to check for new data regularly without excessive repeated imports.
- New sync-service test coverage for automatic import throttling behavior.

### Changed

- Sleep timeline card was redesigned to a staged bar-style timeline with cleaner legend and axis behavior.
- Sleep benchmark bars (duration/heart-rate details) received contrast adjustments for dark and light mode readability.

### Fixed
- Manual `Import sleep data now` now performs all-time backfill import instead of a 30-day test-only import.
- Automatic/sequential sleep import remains incremental (30-day lookback), preserving previously imported historical data while adding/updating newer records.
- Diary and Statistics refresh flows now trigger periodic sleep sync checks similarly to existing steps refresh behavior.
- Removed temporary hardcoded sleep debug data from day overview presentation.

## [0.7.3-alpha.4] - 2026-04-02

This alpha finalizes the Sleep health-score pass. It documents and ships the implemented V1 scoring model, persists additional nightly analysis fields for score completeness and regularity, expands Sleep day/detail messaging and localization, and refreshes core documentation so release notes and docs align with implementation.

### Added
- Sleep Health Score V1 documentation describing the implemented scoring model, component weights, regularity rules, completeness semantics, and known limitations.
- A canonical Sleep current-state document that describes the routed screens, repositories, pipeline flow, persistence layers, and implementation boundaries.
- Persisted nightly-analysis fields for score completeness and regularity outputs, including SRI, valid-day count, and stable/preliminary state.
- Additional localized Sleep copy for empty states, timeline/status labels, sleep-score messaging, regularity messaging, heart-rate messaging, and raw-import metadata in English and German.
- Targeted regression coverage for the updated sleep scoring engine, nightly analysis persistence, pipeline processing, navigation, settings, and regularity index calculation.

### Changed
- Updated the Sleep scoring engine to the implemented `sleep-health-score-v1` model using top-level Duration, Continuity, and Regularity components with renormalization when component data is missing.
- Sleep pipeline analysis now computes nightly regularity history from persisted sessions/stages, carries score completeness and regularity metadata forward, and writes those values into derived nightly analyses.
- Sleep repositories and day-overview composition now expose persisted score-completeness, regularity, and heart-rate sample data to presentation surfaces.
- Sleep day/detail presentation was refined to better communicate unavailable data, import/setup actions, score-quality state, regularity maturity, and heart-rate baseline/sample availability.
- Project documentation was rewritten to be implementation-focused and current-state-first across the README, architecture, data/storage, overview, statistics, and sleep technical references.

### Fixed
- Fixed release/documentation accuracy by replacing stale or historical descriptions with implementation-grounded documentation and clearer boundaries around what is actually implemented.
- Fixed nightly-analysis persistence gaps so newly computed score completeness and regularity fields round-trip through schema migration, DAO writes, and repository mapping.
- Fixed score-model consistency by aligning the pipeline, persisted analysis version, and documentation around the same Sleep Health Score V1 behavior.
## [0.7.3-alpha.3] - 2026-04-01

This alpha significantly expands the Sleep module from early foundation work into a usable end-to-end feature set for testing.

  - **Platform Bridge:** New `MethodChannel` (`hypertrack.health/steps`) with three methods: `getAvailability`, `requestPermissions`, `readStepSegments`.
  - **Sync Service:** Automatic background sync with 48h overlap window, SHA1-based deduplication, and configurable provider filter (All / Apple / Google).
  - **Steps Goal:** Users can set a daily steps goal during onboarding and in the goals screen, with historical goal tracking via `daily_goals_history`.
- **Settings – Health Steps Section:** New settings section to enable/disable step tracking and select the preferred health data provider.
- **Database:** Added `health_step_segments` table with `ON CONFLICT` upsert logic and `target_steps` column in `app_settings` and `daily_goals_history`.

### Changed
- **Smarter Permission Flow:** Permissions are now requested only once when the user enables step tracking in Settings (not on every sync cycle), reducing permission dialog fatigue.
- **Diary Refresh on Return:** The diary screen now automatically refreshes its data when returning from Settings or Profile, ensuring step tracking changes are immediately visible.

### Fixed
- **"App Update Required" on Android 14+:** Added the missing `<activity-alias>` for `VIEW_PERMISSION_USAGE` with `HEALTH_PERMISSIONS` category, which Android 14+ requires to recognize the app as Health Connect-compatible.
- **Sync Error Handling:** `StepsSyncService.sync()` now gracefully catches `PlatformException` when permissions are missing, instead of crashing or repeatedly prompting the user.

### 🚀 Major Release: The "AI Nutrition Overhaul"

This release fundamentally upgrades how meals can be logged by leveraging on-device and cloud AI, drastically reducing the friction of tracking nutrition. It also adds personalized meal recommendations.

### ✨ Top Features
- **AI Meal Capture Screen**: You can now log complex meals automatically via a single photo, voice dictation, or a quick text description. 
- **AI Recommendations**: Receive personalized meal, snack, and drink recommendations directly within the app, specifically tailored to perfectly fill out your remaining daily macronutrients, while respecting your dietary preferences (Vegan, Quick, etc.).
- **Magical AI Interface**: Brand new, fully animated magical UI for AI features, providing visual feedback during analysis with an elegant gradient design.
- **Smart Ingredient Matching**: AI identifies local database items based on the language of your device, combining and portioning foods intuitively (like merging multiple eggs).
- **Privacy Controls**: Added an "AI Kill-Switch" in settings to globally disable all AI interfaces if preferred. API keys are encrypted at rest using native secure storage (`flutter_secure_storage`).

### 🧠 Logic & Database Overhaul
- **Re-ranked Fuzzy Search**: Implemented dart-side re-ranking to prioritize exact database matches, base foods over user creations, and handle compounding accurately. 
- **AI System Prompts**: Custom system prompts block nutritional hallucinations, enforcing the AI to strictly identify weights and component names.
- **No API Lock-in**: Select between OpenAI (GPT-4o) and Google Gemini (Flash) seamlessly depending on your preferred API key.

### 🎨 UI/UX Refinements
- **Glass Bottom Menus**: Introduced consistent glassmorphism to bottom sheets across the entire app for value editing.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Removed heavy neon backgrounds in favor of targeted gradient accents on UI entry points, maintaining a clean and beautiful design language.


## [0.6.0-alpha.3] - 2026-03-05

### ✨ New Feature: AI Kill-Switch (#85)

- **Global toggle**: Added "Enable AI Features" switch in Settings → AI Meal Capture. Defaults to enabled; persisted via SharedPreferences.
- **Conditional UI**: When disabled, all AI entry points disappear without layout gaps:
  - Speed Dial: "AI Meal" action removed from the action list.
  - Nutrition Explorer: Gradient AI button next to barcode scanner hidden.
  - Settings: AI Settings navigation card conditionally shown only when AI is enabled.
- **Localization**: Added `aiEnableTitle` and `aiEnableSubtitle` strings in both English and German.

### 🎨 UI Improvements

- **AI Review Screen**: Replaced plain `AlertDialog` for quantity editing with the app's custom `showGlassBottomMenu` widget, ensuring visual consistency with the rest of the app (glass styling, keyboard-aware padding, visual style adaptation).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **AI Review Quantity Editor**: Fixed `_dependents.isEmpty` assertion crash when closing the quantity editor. Root cause was disposing a `TextEditingController` while the glass bottom menu's exit animation was still playing.

## [0.6.0-alpha.2] - 2026-03-05

### 🎨 UI Redesign: Minimalist AI Interface (#84)

- **Removed gradient overload**: Stripped animated aura background, glassmorphic segmented toggle, gradient mic button, and glassmorphic action buttons from the AI Meal Capture screen.
- **AI gradient now accents entry points only**: Speed-dial icon, Settings entry icon, and Nutrition Explorer search bar icon use a `ShaderMask` rainbow gradient.
- **Analyze button**: Remains the sole gradient CTA with a smooth, deterministic shimmer animation during loading. Text and spinner are rendered above the gradient background.
- **Inline loading**: Replaced the modal `_AnalyzingOverlay` popup with an in-button animated gradient + spinner.
- **Empty states**: Photo, Voice, and Text tabs now show a centered placeholder with a faded icon and helper text when no input is present.
- **Text field fix**: Replaced broken Container+InputBorder.none with proper `OutlineInputBorder` for clean border radius on the text input tab.
- **New entry point**: Added AI icon with gradient accent next to the barcode scanner in the Nutrition Explorer search bar.

### 🧠 AI Logic Improvements

- **Locale-aware prompts**: `AiService` now accepts `languageCode` — the system prompt explicitly instructs the AI to return food names in the user's app language (e.g., "Apfel" not "Apple" when language is "de").
- **Item consolidation**: System prompt rule prevents duplicate entries — "4 eggs" returns one "Egg" entry with combined weight (240g).
- **No nutritional hallucination**: AI is instructed to return only food names and estimated gram weights. Calorie/macro values are looked up from the local database.
- **Simple base names**: AI returns short, generic food names (e.g., "Banane" not "Reife Banane") to maximize database match rates.

### 🔍 Improved Fuzzy Matching

- **Dart-side re-ranking**: `fuzzyMatchForAi` now fetches 20 candidates from SQL, then re-ranks in Dart with priority: exact match → starts-with → shortest partial match.
- **Source priority preserved**: Base foods still rank above user and Open Food Facts entries within each match tier.
- **Accuracy**: Searching for "Apfel" now correctly returns "Apfel" instead of "Erdapfel" or compound dishes.

### 📦 Code Reduction

- `ai_meal_capture_screen.dart`: ~1264 → ~870 lines (−31%), removed 3 animation controllers, 5 glassmorphic widgets, and the modal overlay.

## [0.6.0-alpha.1] - 2026-03-05

### 🚀 New Feature: AI Meal Capture (#81)

Capture meals faster using photos, voice, or text — powered by AI. Users provide their own API key (stored securely via `flutter_secure_storage`), and the app detects foods with estimated quantities, then lets users review and edit before saving.

### ✨ New Features

- **AI Meal Capture Screen**: New screen accessible from the diary FAB for logging meals via:
  - **Photo input**: Take a photo or pick from gallery (up to 4 images for multi-angle accuracy).
  - **Voice input**: Describe your meal by speaking — speech-to-text with on-device recognition.
  - **Text input**: Type a free-form meal description.
- **AI Meal Review Screen**: Review AI-detected foods before saving — edit quantities, swap items, add/remove entries.
- **AI Settings Screen**: Configure API provider (OpenAI GPT-4o or Google Gemini), enter API key, and test connectivity.
- **Multi-Provider AI Service**: Supports both OpenAI and Gemini APIs with dynamic payload formatting and structured JSON response parsing.
- **Complex Meal Handling**: AI system prompt forces decomposition of composite meals into individual ingredients (e.g., "Burger" → bun, patty, lettuce, cheese, sauce).

### 🎨 UI/UX: "Magical" AI Interface

- **Animated Aura Background**: 5 floating gradient orbs (pink, cyan, orange, purple, emerald) on independent coprime animation cycles (13s / 17s / 23s) — the combined pattern repeats only after ~85 minutes, creating truly organic, non-deterministic motion.
- **Glassmorphic Controls**: Custom frosted-glass segmented toggle for input modes with pastel rainbow gradient indicator.
- **Pastel Rainbow Buttons**: Analyze button and microphone button use a washed-out 5-color spectrum (pink → peach → gold → mint → cyan).
- **Enhanced Analyzing Overlay**: Rotating SweepGradient ring, hue-cycling sparkle icon, and animated gradient progress bar during AI processing.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Diary Bug (Critical)**: Fixed AI-detected foods not appearing in the diary. Root cause was mismatched meal type keys — the AI review screen used bare values (`'lunch'`) while the diary expected prefixed keys (`'mealtypeLunch'`).
- **Database Prioritization**: `fuzzyMatchForAi` now strictly orders results: base foods first (priority 0), then user foods (1), then Open Food Facts entries (2), followed by name length.

### 🔧 Permissions & Configuration

- **Android**: Added `RECORD_AUDIO` permission to `AndroidManifest.xml` for voice input.
- **iOS**: Fixed `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` (previously stated "no mic access needed") and added missing `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`.
- **Speech Recognition**: Configured `speech_to_text` with dictation mode, 60s listen duration, 10s pause tolerance, partial results, locale auto-detection, and `cancelOnError: false`.

### 📦 Dependencies

- `speech_to_text: ^7.0.0`
- `flutter_secure_storage` (for API key storage)
- `image_picker` (for photo capture)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-04

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **RIR Field Validation (#83)**: Fixed the RIR (Reps in Reserve) field not correctly accepting and persisting values.
  - The field now defaults to empty/null instead of being hardcoded to 2.
  - Clearing the field correctly persists as null (previously reverted to the old value).
  - Target RIR values from routines now appear as placeholder hints in the Live Workout screen.
  - Non-numeric and negative input is now rejected via input validation.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-03

### 🚀 Major Release: The "Foundation Overhaul"

This release represents a complete modernization of Hypertrack's core architecture. The database has been rebuilt from the ground up, the onboarding experience has been rewritten, and the app has been fully rebranded. After extensive alpha testing, v0.5.0 is the new stable baseline.

### ✨ New Features

- **Complete Onboarding Wizard**: Replaced the old single-page tutorial with a multi-step setup wizard covering Name/Birthday, Height/Gender, Weight, Calories, Macros, and Water goals — all with precise text input fields.
- **Cardio Exercise Support**: The app now fully supports cardio exercises.
  - Dynamic input fields switch from "Kg / Reps" to "Distance (km) / Time (min)" based on exercise category.
  - Cardio routines default to 1 set and summarize as "Total Distance | Total Duration".
- **RIR (Reps In Reserve) Tracking**: Plan and log training intensity with RIR fields in routines, live workouts, and workout history.
- **Session Restoration**: Active workouts now survive app restarts — all logged sets, exercise order, and in-progress values are automatically recovered.
- **Profile 2.0**: Redesigned Profile Screen displaying Age, Gender, and Height alongside the profile picture, with inline editing.
- **Auto-Caffeine Logging**: Caffeinated drinks automatically create corresponding Supplement Log entries.
- **App Initializer Screen**: Database updates now show a clear progress screen during startup instead of running silently in the background.
- **Portrait Lock**: The app orientation is now locked to portrait for a consistent experience.

### 💾 Database & Architecture

- **Schema v6 Migration**: Major database overhaul adding `height`, `gender`, `birthday` to Profiles, `carbsPer100ml` to FluidLogs, and `rir`/`pauseSeconds` columns for workout tracking.
- **Unified goal storage**: User goals (Calories, Macros, Water) migrated from `SharedPreferences` to the SQLite database (`app_settings` table). Changing goals now updates the Dashboard instantly without restart.

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

- **Edit Routine Overhaul**: Completely refactored to match the Live Workout design with `WorkoutCard`, `SetTypeChip`, and consistent column layout.
- **AppBar Consistency**: Fixed back button visibility in light mode across Live Workout and Scanner screens.
- **Scanner Screen**: Cleaned up AppBar styling and simplified the camera layout.

- **Relative Paths**: Converted all internal file paths to relative paths for better portability.
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive project documentation (architecture, data models, UI components).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed workout exercise reordering not being persisted when saving.
- Fixed base food items being buried in search results — search now prioritizes local 'User' and 'Base' items.
- Fixed trailing spaces in search input causing zero results.
- Fixed incomplete (unchecked) "ghost sets" not being cleaned up when finishing a workout.
- Fixed crash in workout summary from incorrect type casting (`num` vs `int`).
- Fixed backup import crashes caused by `int` vs `string` ID conflicts.
- Fixed Supplements being duplicated upon backup import.
- Fixed sugary drinks showing 0g Carbs in fluid tracking.
- Fixed inconsistent UI styling between routine editing and live tracking.
- Improved pause timer logic to persist changes immediately.

## [0.5.0-alpha.5] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- **Branding**: Completed the full rebranding to **Hypertrack**. Updated all project names, package/bundle identifiers, class names, and file references across the entire codebase.
- **Project Structure**: Converted all internal file paths to **relative paths** to ensure consistency and easier portability of the project.

## [0.5.0-alpha.3] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- **Cardio Support**: Introduced specialized tracking for cardio exercises.
  - **Dynamic Input Fields**: Based on exercise category ('Cardio'), the input fields in *Live Workout* and *Routine Editor* automatically switch from "Kg / Reps" to "**Distance (km) / Time (min)**".
  - **Routine Logic**: Cardio exercises in routines now default to 1 set (instead of 3) and initialize with empty fields.
  - **Summary & History**: Cardio results are now summarized as "Total Distance | Total Duration" instead of volume.
- **Detailed Database Initialization**:
  - Replaced background database updates with a dedicated **App Initializer Screen**.
  - This screen blocks the UI during startup, displaying a progress bar and detailed status ("Updating base foods: 1500/9000..."), preventing app lag and missing data issues.

### Fixed
- **Workout Reordering**: Fixed a critical bug where reordering exercises during a live workout was not persisted upon saving. The correct order is now saved to the database history.
- **Search Reliability**:
  - Fixed an issue where base food items (e.g., "Apple") were hidden in search results due to the sheer volume of Open Food Facts entries. Search now prioritizes local 'User' and 'Base' items.
