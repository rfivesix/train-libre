The key remains exclusively local to your device and is never transmitted to us.",
      p_4_a_l3: "<strong>Restricted Data Transmission:</strong> When using the AI analysis, your device sends the captured meal photo or entered text description directly via an encrypted HTTPS connection to the API of the selected AI provider. No personalized account data, user metadata, or historical profile information from Train Libre is attached to these external endpoint payloads.",
      p_4_a_l4: "<strong>Analytical AI Processing (No Generative Coaching):</strong> The AI analysis is used for the <strong>exclusive analytical purpose</strong> of decomposing meal photos or text descriptions into <strong>atomic ingredients</strong>. Train Libre does <strong>not</strong> use AI to dynamically generate or propose personalized recipes, meal plans, or automated health coaching.",
      p_4_a_l5: "<strong>Privacy Protection via System Prompt:</strong> To maximize your privacy, the app's globally stored system prompt is configured to instruct the AI provider to identify only food components and estimate their weight in grams. The AI provider is explicitly instructed <strong>not</strong> to perform any nutrient calculations (such as calories, protein, fat, or carbohydrates). The determination of nutrients is then performed via a <strong>hybrid approach</strong>: recognized food names are matched against your <strong>local offline database</strong> using a deterministic <strong>Jaro-Winkler-based matching engine</strong> (SQLite/Drift).",

      p_4_b_t: "B. Offline Catalog Updates (Open Food Facts & Exercise Catalog)",
      p_4_b_c1: "To scan food barcodes offline and look up exercises, Train Libre uses local product and exercise catalogs. These catalogs are downloaded directly to your device as precompiled SQLite database files.",
      p_4_b_l1: "<strong>How it Works:</strong> The app checks at regular intervals whether updates are available for the food catalog (based on Open Food Facts) or the exercise catalog (based on wger/GitHub). The check and subsequent download of the compressed catalog databases are performed via an encrypted HTTPS connection directly to the servers of the hosting service provider (e.g., GitHub Pages / GitHub Inc. or Open Food Facts).",
      p_4_b_l2: "<strong>Data Minimization:</strong> When downloading catalog updates, technical connection data (in particular your IP address, date/time of access, and the app's User-Agent) are transmitted to the host as a system requirement. No user-generated data, scanned barcodes, or personal profile characteristics are sent to the catalog hosts at any time.",
      p_4_b_l3: "<strong>Local Barcode Mapping:</strong> The matching of a scanned barcode or the search for food and exercises takes place 100 percent offline on your device. Unlike conventional nutrition apps, scanning a product does not send a request with the barcode to a cloud server.",
      p_5_t: "5. Health Data Interfaces",
      p_5_c1: "Train Libre can interact with your operating system's system-wide health databases (Apple HealthKit on iOS or Google Health Connect on Android). This interaction takes place exclusively locally on your end device and requires your explicit approval, which can be revoked at any time, in the system settings of the respective operating system.",
      p_5_a_t: "A. Data Import (Reading)",
      p_5_a_c1: "If you grant permission to the app, Train Libre reads data from Apple HealthKit or Google Health Connect to display and process it locally within the app:",
      p_5_a_l1: "<strong>Step Counts:</strong> Import of recorded step count segments for offline evaluation.",
      p_5_a_l2: "<strong>Sleep Data:</strong> Import of sleep intervals and sleep phases.",
      p_5_a_l3: "<strong>Heart Rate:</strong> Import of heart rate samples to calculate local hourly aggregations.",
      p_5_a_c2: "The import is used exclusively for display and local analysis within Train Libre. No transfer of this imported data to external servers takes place.",
      p_5_b_t: "B. Data Export (Writing & Idempotency)",
      p_5_b_c1: "At your request, Train Libre can export data manually recorded in the app to the system health databases (Apple HealthKit / Google Health Connect):",
      p_5_b_l1: "<strong>Body Dimensions:</strong> Export of weight measurements.",
      p_5_b_l2: "<strong>Nutrition and Hydration:</strong> Export of consumed nutritional values, calories, and water amounts.",
      p_5_b_l3: "<strong>Workouts:</strong> Export of completed training sessions.",
      p_5_b_c2: "<strong>Local Idempotency Protection:</strong> To prevent duplicate data from being written to your system health database during repeated synchronizations, Train Libre features a local logging system. In the <code>health_export_records</code> table of the local SQLite database, a unique ID, the target platform (Apple Health or Health Connect), the data domain, and a unique idempotency key are stored together with the export timestamp for every successful write operation. This comparison takes place purely locally on your device and serves to ensure data consistency.",
      p_6_t: "6. Data Security & Backups",
      p_6_c1: "Since all data resides locally on your end device, the security of the device is critical to protecting your data.",
      p_6_a_t: "A. Local Data Isolation",
      p_6_a_c1: "The operating system (iOS/Android) isolates Train Libre's app data using sandbox mechanisms. Other installed applications do not have access to the local SQLite database or the API keys stored in the secured app settings without your consent.",
      p_6_b_t: "B. Manual and Automatic Backups",
      p_6_b_c1: "The app offers functions to back up your data in order to prevent data loss in the event of device replacement or damage.",
      p_6_b_l1: "1. <strong>File Generation and Export:</strong> You can generate a complete backup of all data stored in the SQLite database and in the settings. This backup is generated as a structured JSON file in the operating system's temporary storage area and exported via the system's own share menu (Share Sheet). After the export, the temporary file is deleted immediately.",
      p_6_b_l2: "2. <strong>Encryption:</strong> To protect your sensitive data, backups can be encrypted with a password of your choice before export. The encryption is performed locally on the device using strong cryptographic algorithms. Unencrypted backups should always be stored in secure locations.",
      p_6_b_l3: "3. <strong>Automatic Backups:</strong> You can enable automatic backups at configurable intervals. On Android, this feature uses the Storage Access Framework (SAF) to save directly to a target folder selected by you. Alternatively, the file is saved in the local app document directory. These backup files remain on your device unless you actively copy them to an external cloud storage location (e.g., iCloud Drive or Google Drive).",
      p_6_b_l4: "4. <strong>System Backups:</strong> Please note that if system-wide device backups are enabled (e.g., via Apple iCloud or Google Drive Backup), Train Libre's application data will by default be uploaded to the respective cloud by the operating system. This is beyond our control and can be disabled for Train Libre in your device's system settings.",
      p_7_t: "7. Data Subject Rights",
      p_7_c1: "As a data subject, you have extensive rights under the GDPR. Since Train Libre is a local-first app, you can exercise most of these rights directly and independently within the app without depending on our cooperation.",
      p_7_l1: "<strong>Right of Access (Article 15 of the GDPR) & Data Portability (Article 20 of the GDPR):</strong> You have the right to know what data is stored in the app. You can view your entire database yourself at any time and export it in a machine-readable format (JSON file) using the integrated backup export function. You can also export reports in standard formats (such as CSV).",
      p_7_l2: "<strong>Right to Rectification (Article 16 of the GDPR):</strong> You can correct or change all profile data, workouts, nutrition logs, body weights, and settings entered manually by you at any time directly in the app's user interfaces.",
      p_7_l3: "<strong>Right to Erasure / \"Right to be Forgotten\" (Article 17 of the GDPR):</strong> You can manually delete individual records (e.g., a specific workout or food log) in the app.",
